# Exploratory Data Analysis App

The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) App is a Streamlit-based web application that allows users to perform comprehensive exploratory data analysis on their datasets. It provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for uploading CSV files, visualizing the input data, and generating an interactive profiling report.

## About

This project simplifies the process of exploratory data analysis. Leveraging the power of [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) for interactive web interfaces and [ydata_profiling](https://github.com/ydata-ai/ydata-profiling) for generating detailed profiling reports, the app enables quick insights into your dataâ€”all in one place.
